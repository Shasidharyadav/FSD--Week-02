                Mini Bio
            </h2>
            <p>Kamal Haasan was born November 7, 1954 in Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu. He debuted
                as
                a child artiste in the film "Kalathoor Kannamma" (1960). Since then, he has starred in nearly 220
                films
                in the major Indian languages - Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi. He has been a part of
                the
                film industry for 60 years, as of 2020. His journey in cinema has seen him do various roles - from
                child
                artiste, to romantic lead to one of the most respected and revered heroes of the film industry
                today.
                <br><br>

                He has famously said that he is a reluctant actor. He has an avid interest in every aspect of film
                making and is known for his work as a choreographer, director, and writer, as well. <br> <br>

                He wrote his first script at age 18 for the film "Unarchigal" (1976), which was then followed by
                films
                that have gone on to become cult classics - Rajapaarvai (1981), Sathya (1988), Apoorva Sahotharargal
                (1989), Thevar Magan (1992), Mahanadi (1994), Kurudhippunal (1995), Avvai Shanmugi (1996), Hey Ram
                (2000), Pammal K Sambandam (2002), Panchathanthiram (2002), Anbe Sivam (2003), are a few of the
                films
                etched in popular memory for having set the bar for craftsmanship in the fields of screenplay,
                script,
                and dialogue. <br> <br>

                He is also a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction in Tamil and his published work is testament
                to
                his constant exploration of structure and form. <br> <br>

                Kamal Haasan's strong convictions in his art have led to some of Indian cinema's most path-breaking
                films like Pushpak / Pushpaka Vimaanam / Pesum Padam (1987). Kamal Haasan also worked as a
                choreographer
                while transitioning as a well-known child artiste to the lead actor in a feature length film. Some
                of
                his best-known work as a dancer can be seen in Saagara Sangamam (1983) and the popular hit Punnagai
                Mannan (1986). <br> <br>

                Kamal Haasan is also a student of Carnatic music, studying under musical maestro Dr.
                Balamuralikrishna.
                One of his biggest hits as a playback singer was the song "Inji Iduppazhagi" for the film Thevar
                Magan.
                <br> <br>

                His career as a director began with the film Chachi 420 (1997), the Hindi remake of Avvai Shanmugi.
                Since then he has called the shots for critically acclaimed films like "Hey Ram" and "Virumaandi".
                <br>
                <br>

                He has never hesitated to state his opinions and encourage debate about topics that are socially
                relevant. He is a rationalist in thought and moderate in opinion and a humanist in philosophy. The
                need
                to be socially conscious is seen in the way his fan clubs have revamped themselves into entities
                that
                carry out charity and volunteer work.

                    A London editor once told me that the best way to put news hounds off your scent is to lie
                    inventively <br><br>
                    The closest I feel to is Dustin Hoffman who shares many of my paradoxes. Physical appearance to
                    begin with. <br><br>
                    I haven't got a degree. So, I've never stopped learning. When you get a degree, and wear that
                    square
                    hat with tassels on it, you think you've done it and you lean back. There is a certain amount of
                    complacency that comes with achievement. What you perceive is achievement. When you don't, when
                    you
                    are insecure all the time, that's when you constantly forage for knowledge in the extra-mural
                    dump. <br><br>
                    Strangely, one of the greatest rationalists of this world has been turned into a god:
